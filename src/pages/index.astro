					<p class="leading-relaxed text-l mb-[20px]">I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from the University of MÃ¡laga, and I've been honing my skills as a software engineer for nearly two years. My professional journey includes optimizing database pipelines, leading chatbot integrations, and automating processes to enhance efficiency.<p>

Currently, I work with Node.js and TypeScript but have a deep love for Go, particularly with the Fiber framework. I'm also diving into Svelte for front-end development and have my sights set on mastering Rust soon.<p>
